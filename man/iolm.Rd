}
\arguments{

\item{data}{an abstract data frame, or something which can be
coerced to one.}

\item{subset}{an options character string, which will be evaluated in the
frame of the data, to indicate which rows to include
in the analysis}

\item{weights}{a optional character string, which will be evaluated in the
frame of the data, giving the sample weights for the regression}

\item{na.action}{a function which indicates what should happen when the data
contain 'NA's. See lm.fit for more details.}

\item{offset}{a optional character string, which will be evaluated in the
frame of the data, giving the offsets for the regression}
